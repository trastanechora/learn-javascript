# How to start using JavaScript in your terminal
In order to run any JavaScript script on your terminal, you have to install `node.js`. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine.
## Linux
```
$ sudo apt-get install nodejs
$ sudo apt-get install npm
```
## Mac OSX
```
$ brew update
$ brew install node
```
## Windows
Visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and follow the instructions

To make sure `node.js` has already installed in your machine, type in your terminal
```
node --version
```
If you didn't get any error you should get the version of the `node.js` and you are ready to rock!
