# Variable
Variables are used to store information in a computer program, they provide a way of labeling data with a descriptive name and they have data type (boolean, numeric, string). A variable in JavaScript can contain any data. A variable can at one moment be a string and at another be a number.

Variable naming is in `camelCase` and you can declare any variable with `var`, `let`, and `const`

## String
In JavaScript, there are 3 types of quotes.
1. Double quotes: "Hello".
2. Single quotes: 'Hello'.
3. Backticks: `Hello`.

## Number
The number type represents both integer and floating point numbers. There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication *, division /, addition +, subtraction -, and so on. Infinity represents the mathematical Infinity ∞. It is a special value that’s greater than any number. NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect or an undefined mathematical operation
